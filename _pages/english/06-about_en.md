## Agile Duos
For public seminars, we act as an agile duo. Two speakers with different backgrounds and industry knowledge are there for you the whole time. More variety for you with two speakers, more 'war stories' from real project life, ...

These numerous, diverse project experiences of the duo will allow you to form your own opinions on all of the workshop topics.
