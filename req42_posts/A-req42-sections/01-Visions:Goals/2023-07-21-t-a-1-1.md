Certainly, you can start with a disorganized collection of ideas of what you could do. You might even be able to deliver parts of them very quickly and early on. However, the danger is that - if you live from hand to mouth - you will never be able to create something orderly as a whole, or you will realize too late that the individual activities are not goal-oriented. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you definitely give some time to the goals/visions chapter. Only when you know where you want to go, you can also take the first steps in the right direction.
