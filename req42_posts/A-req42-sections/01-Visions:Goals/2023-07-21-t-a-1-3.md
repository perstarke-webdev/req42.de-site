The number of requirements for a product may be dozens, hundreds or even thousands. The number of business goals should be limited to 1 - 5. And this handful of goals (as well as requirements in general) should be prioritized according to business criteria. After all, when push comes to shove, everyone involved needs to know what they should focus on. Nobody can focus on 20 goals at the same time - so please agree on 1 - 5 important goals with the relevant stakeholders.
