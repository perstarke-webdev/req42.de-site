Visions or business goals are the most abstract form of requirements. The difference is most likely to be in the precision with which they can be formulated. With visions, you may not yet have a concrete idea of how quickly and with what effort they can come true.

Consider John F. Kennedy, who expressed a vision: "I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth." And that was at a time when it wasn't clear how that could even work technically.

Goals (compared to visions) should definitely be measurable. This can also help you distinguish visions from goals: If you don't yet have a clue how to achieve the desired result or would test achievement, better call it a "vision" - and work on refining it into more concrete goals.
