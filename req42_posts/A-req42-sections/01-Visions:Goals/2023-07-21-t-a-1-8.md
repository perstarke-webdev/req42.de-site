Sprint goals are "basic hygiene" in agile projects. If a development team takes responsibility for the implementation of 7 - 10 stories in the next sprint, then it is worth explicitly formulating a sprint goal during sprint planning. Since we are talking more about 1 - 4 weeks here, such sprint goals do not necessarily need to be explicitly stated in a requirements repository. They only serve to focus the development team in case they don't manage to complete all of the planned stories. In this case, everyone involved should know what should definitely be completed - and where it may be possible to cut corners in case of wrong estimatates. For project management, the longer-term goals (as described in Tip 1-7) are perfectly adequate.
