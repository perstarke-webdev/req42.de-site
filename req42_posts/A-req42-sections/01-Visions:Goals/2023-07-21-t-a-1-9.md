For product developments with a time horizon of less than 12 months, don't make an effort to formally separate visions and goals. Just remember: The development team needs to know what they are supposed to achieve in which timeframe - no more and no less. Therefore, choose any name for chapter 2 of req42. We prefer the more tangible word "goals" or "business objectives" rather than the vague word "vision." (We recall the now-famous quote by former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who said, "Anyone who has visions should see a doctor.")
