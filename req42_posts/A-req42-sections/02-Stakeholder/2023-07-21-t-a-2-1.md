Remember: Forgotten stakeholders are forgotten requirements. Therefore, sit down with your core team for 15 minutes and list all the people and organizations that have an interest in your project. You willcertainly create 20 - 30 entries very quickly.
Then send this list to everyone on that list and ask for additions. Whom have we forgotten? This costs little effort, but brings great effect. With this snowball effect, your stakeholder list becomes quite complete quite easily.
