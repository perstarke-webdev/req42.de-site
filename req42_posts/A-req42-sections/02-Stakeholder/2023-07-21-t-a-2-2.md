The order "role before person" in the stakeholder table has been chosen deliberately. This order has proven itself, since requirements normally always represent wishes from the perspective of a role. However, the person taking on the role may well change during the project. If required, you can also add further columns (contact data, ...) - but please consider the effort for their maintenance.
