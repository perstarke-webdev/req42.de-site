Especially when working under time pressure, you will probably only be able to attend to a few of your stakeholders. Especially in such cases, a visual classification according to interest and influence can help instead of a stakeholder table (see figure below). You can make such a classification very informally on the flipchart in the team and then transfer it to your req42 documentation if required.

* High influence and high interest: These are people you should involve and/or manage intensively. Make every effort to satisfy this category of stakeholder in all respects. Actively reach out to these individuals in communications.
* High influence, lower interest: Invest just enough effort to satisfy these stakeholders.
* Low influence, high interest: These stakeholders can be very helpful in working on the system: Actively involve them in the work on the system, keep them adequately informed. In particular, they can provide feedback on all kinds of technical or business details.
* Little influence, little interest: Here you can minimize your effort and, for example, provide information that these stakeholders consume only when needed.

Ideally, you have a stakeholder table plus such a classification.

Note: Some stakeholders might consider their own influence/power higher than this classification reflects. Thus beware: publishing this matrix might cause annoyance to some stakeholders.
