Define "what's inside" your product and what's outside.

You should demarcate your product from other systems in order to show how it
fits into the existing environment, which external interfaces are offered or consumed and what users or roles are using the system or receiving information from it.

That way you show the scope of your product: what are the responsibilities
of your product and what are the responsibilities of its neighbors.
