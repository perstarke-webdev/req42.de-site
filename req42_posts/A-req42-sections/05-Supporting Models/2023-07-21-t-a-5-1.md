If you took your first professional steps in IT in the 1990s, you are probably familiar with use case models by Ivar Jacobson. He was not the first (nor the last) to put a process-oriented decomposition of a product at the center of his method. Use cases (like user stories) have the advantage that they are triggered in the context of the product (or by a time trigger) and promise a valuable outcome to the trigger. Thus, they meet three of the important INVEST criteria: 

1. they are (I) independent of each other - and can therefore also be implemented (relatively) independently of each other.
2. they are (N) negotiable: most use cases are still very large functionalities for which you can negotiate with the stakeholders which parts of them should perhaps be implemented earlier and which later.
3. they are (V) valuable: for whoever wants the process from the outside, the result hopefully represents value. Otherwise, what would the process have been triggered for.

While finding epics is a more gut-driven process, there is a large number of methodological approaches for finding use cases that lead to a very natural decomposition of a large system. (In our courses, we reveal these to you and also let you practice the approach).
