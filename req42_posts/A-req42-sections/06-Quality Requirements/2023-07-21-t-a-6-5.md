If you know a concrete requirement, just write it down. Either as a backlog item in chapter 4 or as a quality requirement in chapter 6. It is useless to argue whether *"The user shall log in with name and password "* is a function or already a proposed solution for the more general security requirement *"The user shall identify him-/herself appropriately in the system "*. The latter leaves more degrees of freedom for the development team to decide the type of identification, the former takes those degrees of freedom away from the development team.
