The checklists and categorization schemes for qualities contain many categories. Of course, we want to specify all of them in the course of the project. However, at the very beginning, you should find the top 3 to top 5 of them that may cause the project to fail if they are not met.

Make sure that your development teams are aware of this importance and do not get bogged down with other minor issues.
