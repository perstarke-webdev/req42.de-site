When you document, you have to adapt the documentation to the requirements when they change. You create work for the future, so to speak, with every piece pf documentation. We are of the opinion that documentation is fundamentally necessary and useful - but only to an extent appropriate to the product and the stakeholders!

We represent the following theses in this regard:

* Less (i.e. shorter) documentation can be read faster (i.e. in less time) by stakeholders.
* Less documentation means fewer changes to this documentation in the future.

Please make a conscious decision about which amount of documentation and which level of detail make sense for your product and your current situation. Differentiate between short-lived communication (for example: "flipcharts for project work") and long-lived documentation.
Show "courage to leave gaps": deliberately drop or minimize parts of req42.
