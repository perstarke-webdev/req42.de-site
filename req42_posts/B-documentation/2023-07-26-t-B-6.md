For your documentation, concrete usefulness should be more important to you than global or general principles - because most of us get paid for achieving goals, but very few people get paid for following principles.

In this sense, you should regard req42 or other templates as pragmatic tools rather than as "non-negotiable principles". You should (!) never think of req42 as a form to be filled, but as a cabinet offering compartments: fill the cabinet compartments as appropriate for your current situation.

Stefan ZÃ¶rner calls this, "Be pragmatic with templates."

**Note:** Safety-critical systems obey different rules. Pragmatism and shortcuts are forbidden in such systems. The criticality of these systems requires thoroughness and adherence to formal rules - the pragmatism we propagate is often not applicable for such systems.
