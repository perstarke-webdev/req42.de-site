Stefan ZÃ¶rner put it in a great way: Make documentation a "friend word" in your project.

Documentation should help, not hinder or be a burden. Make "requirements capture" an integral part of your approach. For example, include an up-to-date requirements documentation as one clause in your Definition-of-Done (if you develop agile, which we hope you do).
