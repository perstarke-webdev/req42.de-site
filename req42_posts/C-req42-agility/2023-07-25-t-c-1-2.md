We firmly believe that even in small product development efforts you should have some requirements documentation available when you finish an iteration or publish a release.

Such documentation about the already implemented requirements will save you a lot of work for future releases. It is easier to specify changes than to start from scratch.

Therefore we believe that requirements documentation should be an integral part of the DoD. If not, then it surely won't be done.
