Imagine you're a future stakeholder who then needs to work on extensions or modifications of the product. Then ask yourself what information about past requirements you need to have...

We suggest:

1. Explicitly create an overview of stakeholders (organizations, roles, people) for your product.
2. Ask representatives of every stakeholder group about their needs and wishes about requirements documentation
3. Prioritize their answers, add important stuff to your Definition-of-Done
4. Act accordingly during product development
