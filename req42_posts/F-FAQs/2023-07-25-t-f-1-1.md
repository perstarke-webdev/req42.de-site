"42" is a quote from the early science fiction novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by British author Douglas Adams. In this book, the number 42 is satirized as the "answer to all questions, the meaning of life and the origin of the universe.

Among IT folks, 42 is often used as a magic number - as a numerical value without deeper meaning, which can be replaced by any other number.

We like this number and have introduced req42 following the  architecture template arc42 (https://arc42.de) that is already available since more than two decades.
