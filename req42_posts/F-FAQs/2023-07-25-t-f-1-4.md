We (the authors) know of many dozens of companies and organizations in the German-speaking world that actively use req42 for different products and domains. We do not know any statistically relevant numbers. 

In our opinion, only a few alternatives for agile requirements documentation are established in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Internationally, the VOLERE template by Suzanne and James Robertson, Peter Hruschka's English partners, has become widely used (www.volere.co.uk). 

req42 is a pragmatically reduced variant of VOLERE for the agile market.
