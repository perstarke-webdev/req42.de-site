Yes, your are very welcome!

* The req42 framework is maintained as an open-souce project at [req42-github]. You can report bugs and suggestions there and place your suggestions for improvement as GIT pull requests. (If you don't know what PRs are at all - just email us YOUR suggestions to info@req42.

* You can publish req42 documentation of a product, because many req42 users ask us for more examples. Please make sure that you have the necessary rights to texts and diagrams, because many organizations and companies consider the requirements for a system as confidential *intellectual property* and prohibit publication.

* You are welcome to document a sample product in req42 - or even just an example of one or another req42 artifact - regardless of your professional activity. We are also available as a sparring partner for this and are happy to link to your examples from our sites.
