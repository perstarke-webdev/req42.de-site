No, req42 works **completely** (!!) independent of notation or syntax:

You can use textual notations like the story format, or use tables. For the models you can use UML, or any kinds of box-and-arrow diagrams, hand-drawn sketches, entity-relationship diagrams or even your favorite drawing tool... 

The notations alone won't decide about the quality of your requirements :-)
